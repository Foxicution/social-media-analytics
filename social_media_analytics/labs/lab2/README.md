# Social Media Analytics: Lab 2

## Overview

In this lab, we delve into the intricacies of social network analysis. We either choose from one of the datasets provided by the instructor or create our own. Using this dataset, we construct a social network and measure its key parameters.

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Data Preparation

- **Dataset Selection**: Choose one from the datasets provided on Moodle by the instructor or create a custom dataset.
- **Social Network Construction**: Using the chosen dataset, construct a social network.

### 2. Measurement of Node and Network Parameters

- **Node Parameters**:
  - `Degrees`: The number of connections a node has.
  - `Distance Matrix`: A matrix representing the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.
  - `Closeness`: How close a node is to all other nodes in the network.
  - `Betweenness`: A measure of a node's centrality in a network.
  - `Clustering Coefficients`: A measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.

- **Network Parameters**:
  - `Diameter`: The longest shortest path between any two nodes in the network.
  - `Centralization Scores`: A measure of the dispersion of all nodes' centrality scores.
  - `Cliques`: Fully connected subgraphs within the network.
  - `Clustering Coefficient`: The degree to which nodes in the entire network tend to cluster together.
  - `Modularity`: A measure of the strength of division of a network into modules.

### 3. Data Description

- **Work Description**: A brief overview of the tasks and methods used in this lab.
- **Network Characterization**: Define and describe the network, detailing the source of the data.
- **Key Parameters**: Discuss the main parameters, how they were calculated, and the results obtained.
- **Network Explanation**: Interpret and explain the network based on the obtained key parameters.
